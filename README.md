This project was created as a jQuery and ES6 exercise. It is a work in progress.


known issues:

* When users win a match on the last turn, bug causes the "draw" message, instead of alerting the winner

* Player # does not switch to proper player in following rounds after certain situations

Future updates:

* Currently working on adding X's and O's, rather than changing color of squares

* Will be adding jQuery animations to h1
